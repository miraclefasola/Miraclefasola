<h2>🚀 About Me</h2>

I’m currently a learner in the <strong><a href="https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering/">ALX Backend Engineering Program</a></strong>, where I’m being challenged daily to think like an engineer and build real-world systems from the ground up.

I'm deeply passionate about solving meaningful problems through technology — especially in a way that impacts lives in Africa and beyond. With a background in Zoology and a knack for creative problem-solving, I’m charting a unique path into backend development.

- 🧠 I'm curious about system design, low-level programming, and how things work under the hood.
