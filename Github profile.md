# 👋🏽 Hi, I’m Miracle Fasola  
**Backend Engineering Student @ ALX | Problem Solver | Future Tech Founder**

---

I’m not just learning to code — I’m learning to build. I believe in solving real problems with clean logic, clear structure, and a bit of curiosity-driven fire.

I'm currently deep in the trenches of the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, focused on becoming one of the best **Backend Engineers** Nigeria has ever produced. I'm obsessed with debugging, thinking in systems, and turning lines of code into tools that make people’s lives easier.

## 💡 What I’m Working On  
- Strengthening my core in **Python**, Git/GitHub, Linux & Shell scripting  
- Building and testing **RESTful APIs** with Python frameworks  
- Mastering database logic with **PostgreSQL**  
- Exploring **AWS Cloud Fundamentals**  
- Writing clean, scalable backend logic  
- Documenting projects for real-world use and collaboration

## 🧠 Core Strengths  
- **Problem Solving** – I live for the “aha!” moment  
- **Critical Thinking** – I break down complex ideas into logical, simple steps  
- **Prioritization & Focus** – I obsess over doing the right thing at the right time  
- **Debugging** – If it breaks, I stay on it until it clicks  
- **Creative Logic** – I enjoy connecting unlikely dots

## 🚀 My Vision  
To prove you can succeed in tech with **integrity**, **resilience**, and **honest hard work**.  
To inspire others — especially young Africans — to choose purpose over shortcuts.  
To one day build tools that people across the world rely on daily.
